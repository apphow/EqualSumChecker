# EqualSumChecker
# Challenge from Tim Buchalka's Java Programming Masterclass for Software Developers course.

Wrige a method hasEqualSum with 3 parameters of type int.

The method should return boolean and it needs to return true if the sum of the first and second
parameters is equal to the third parameter. Otherwise, return false.

EXAMPLES OF INPUT/OUTPUT:

  * hasEqualSum(1, 1, 1); should return false since 1 + 1 is not equal to 1
  
  * hasEqualSum(1, 1, 2); should return true since 1 + 1 is equal to 2
  
  * hasEqualSum(1, -1, 0); should return true since 1 + (-1) is equal to 0
  
NOTE: The hasEqualSum method needs to be defined as public static.

NOTE: Do not add a main method to solution code.
